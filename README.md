# LLM-for-Language-Translation

This Notebook is a beginner-level and simple demonstration of NMT (Neural Machine Translation) using mBART (Multilingual Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model.

I have implemented how mBART can be deployed to translate English Language into few Indian Languages namely :

 Tamil, Bengali, Gujarathi, Hindi, Malayalam, Marathi and Telungu.
